### CubeWorld

A simple OpenGL practice project rendering cubes and textures, using custom utility classes I wrote
Camera.h and Shader.h (https://github.com/martinlai/OpenGLUtility), and code adapted from these tutorials
http://learnopengl.com/


##Usage

Clone the repository and execute CubeWorld.exe (make sure that the folders Textures/ and Shaders/ are in the same directory)
